# IS2021Assignment
This is a project implemented for Interactive Systems 2021 - Saarland University


## Arduino Pipeline
**Objective:** Code Conversion from Morse to hexadecimal using Wemos D1 mini microcontroller.<br>
Input is given using switch and output is represented using rotation of servo motor.<br>
Alternate input of Infrared Leds used to provide morse codes<br>
DIY done using LEDs to represent hexadecimal values in 8-digit format.<br>

## Unity3D Pipeline
**Objective:** Visualisation of code conversion in Unity3D using ball game. 

## Arduino and Unity3D Communication
Communication from Arduino to Unity3D and vice versa

Remote communication also done.
